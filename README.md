# discord.js template:
Is a discord.js template for beginners who don't know where to begin.

# How to use:
  To start the bot, run download the modules that you need! You can do so by running this command!    
  ```
  npm i
  ```
  If this project has the modules outdated in the `package.json` folder, you can run the following to update them!
  ```
  npm update
  ```
  Go to the `config.json` file and add the items such as the prefix and owner ID!     
  Since the index.js reads the token via the `.env` file, you need to create a .env file and put in the following:
  ```
  token = TOKEN_HERE
  ```
  For a valid invite link for your bot, go to the `DIRECTIONS.txt` file and replace your client id and permisions value
  
  Once you are done, you can run the bot!
