# discord.js template:
Is a discord.js template for beginners who don't know where to begin.

# How to use:
  To start the bot, run download the modules that you need! You can do so by running this command!    
  ```
  npm i
  ```
  If this project has the modules outdated in the `package.json` folder, you can run the following to update them!
  ```
  npm update
  ```
  Go to the `config.json` file and add the items such as the prefix and owner ID!     
  Since the index.js reads the token via the `.env` file, you need to create a .env file and put in the following:
  ```
  token = TOKEN_HERE
  ```
# Invite Link
  replace current placeholder id with your bot's client id for a valid discord bot invite link\
  replace permissions value (you can generate one in the discord developer portal)\
  ```https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=123456789&scope=bot&permissions=8```
